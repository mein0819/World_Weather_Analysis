# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The first purpose of this project is to analyze weather data obtained from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
to find patterns based on latitude and longitude. The second part of the project uses that weather data to create a map 
of hotels using APIs from [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com/) based on specified weather criteria set by the user. This feature was further refactored to create a travel route between four cities that are chosen as a travel itinerary.
